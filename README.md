# Insecure Express.js Route Handler with Inadequate Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common vulnerability in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that fails to properly handle errors from database interactions, potentially exposing sensitive information to clients. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a secure solution.

**Vulnerability:**
The original code lacks proper error handling when fetching user data. If an error occurs during the database query, it sends the raw error object to the client, which might reveal sensitive database details like connection strings or table structures. 

**Solution:**
The improved code handles errors gracefully, sending a generic error message to the client without exposing internal details. This protects the application from information leakage and enhances security.
